# Examples for the course about modern Object Pascal

## BSC course information

These examples have been prepared to explain Pascal language features during the course organized by [BSC](https://www.bsc.com.pl/) and directed at Delphi developers.

The course, and these examples, has been taught by _Michalis Kamburelis_, author of [Modern Object Pascal Introduction for Programmers](https://castle-engine.io/modern_pascal) and [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

[Course information is here](https://www.bsc.com.pl/szkolenie-nowoczesny-obiektowy-pascal/). It happened, online, on 2025-04-09 and 2025-04-10. If you're interested in attending the next edition or similar courses, [let BSC know](https://www.bsc.com.pl/about/kontakt/).

## Examples

This repository contains the examples used during the course.

**Compatibility**: Almost all the examples should compile with:

- either Delphi or FPC compilers (we tested Delphi 12, FPC 3.2.2, FPC 3.3.1 from 2025-03-02),

- any operating system (we tested Windows and Linux).

The exceptions are

- Examples in `140_forms_etc` and `150_data_module_using_components`, which will compile only with Delphi, as they depend on FMX / VCL.

- Examples in `310_anonymous`, `305_callbacks_assigning`, `300_callbacks_events` which show anonymous functions and function references. They will compile only in Delphi or FPC >= 3.3.1. Older FPC 3.2.2 didn't have anonymous functions and function references implemented.

Note: Most of the examples show the correct, recommended way of doing something. They should work correctly and exhibit no memory leaks. The exceptions are examples marked with `DELIBERATELY_INCORRECT` in the directory name -- these are knowingly incorrect for some reason, to illustate something.

Note: We chose to use FPC "Delphi mode" for these examples, to have the simplest code that compiles with both Delphi and FPC. An alternative would be to use FPC "ObjFpc mode", which in our opinion brings some benefits over "Delphi mode" (e.g. `@` for callbacks has more sane behavior), but also more incompatibilities with Delphi (which would need to be addressed by adding `{$ifdef FPC}` or `{$ifdef FPC_OBJFPC}` around the code).
